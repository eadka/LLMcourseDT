Check 'Hyper-V', then click OK. You may need to restart your computer.\\n\\n3. **Download Docker Desktop**: Visit the Docker website and download Docker Desktop for Windows.\\n\\n4. **Install Docker Desktop**: Run the installer and follow the prompts. Make sure to enable the option to use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V if you prefer using WSL.\\n\\n5. **Start Docker**: After installation, launch Docker Desktop from your Start menu. It may take a few minutes for it to initialize.\\n\\n6. **Verify Installation**: Open a command prompt or PowerShell and run `docker --version`. You should see the installed version of Docker.\\n\\n7. **Run Your First Container**: You can test your Docker installation by running `docker run hello-world` to download and run a test image.\\n\\nYou are now set to use Docker on Windows 10!\",\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Install Required Packages**:\n",
      "   - Ensure that all necessary Python packages are installed. For example, if you encounter a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `psycopg2`, install it using:\n",
      "     ```bash\n",
      "     pip install psycopg2-binary\n",

      "     pip install psycopg2-binary --upgrade\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Follow Docker Best Practices**:\n",
      "   - Store all your code in your default Linux distro for better file system performance, especially if you're on Windows (10 Home/11 Home) using Docker with WSL2 backend.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Utilize Resources and Documentation**:\n",
      "   - Refer to the Docker documentation on best practices for installation and configuration.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Debugging Common Errors**:\n",
      "   - If you run into specific errors like `TypeError: 'module' object is not callable`, check your connection string format:\n",
      "     ```python\n",
      "     conn_string = \"postgresql+psycopg://root:root@localhost:5432/ny_taxi\"\n",
      "     engine = create_engine(conn_string)\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Stay Engaged with the Course Community**:\n",
      "   - Participate in discussion forums and ask questions about any difficulties you encounter.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Practice Regularly**:\n",
      "   - Regular hands-on practice with Docker and Terraform commands will reinforce your learning and help you troubleshoot common issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Review the Course Materials**:\n",
      "   - Go over the lecture notes, assignments, and example projects provided in the module to solidify your understanding.\n",
